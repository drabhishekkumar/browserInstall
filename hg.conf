# if you want a different default species selection on the Gateway
# page, change this default Human to one of the genomes from the
# defaultDb table in hgcentral:
# hgsql -e "select genome from defaultDb;" hgcentral
# If you need a different version of that specific genome, change
# the defaultDb table entry, for example, a different mouse genome
# version as default:
# hgsql -e 'update defaultDb set name="mm8" where genome="Mouse"
# then this defaultGenome would read: defaultGenome=Mouse
defaultGenome=Human

# trackDb table to use. A simple value of `trackDb' is normally sufficient.
# In general, the value is a comma-separated list of trackDb format tables to
# search.  This supports local tracks combined with a mirror of the trackDb
# table from UCSC. The names should be in the form `trackDb_suffix'. This
# implies a parallel hgFindSpec format search table exists in the form
# hgFindSpec_suffix.  The specified trackDb tables are searched in the order
# specified, with the first occurance of a track being used.  You may associate
# trackDb/hgFindSpec tables with other instances of genome databases using a
# specification of dbProfile:trackDbTbl, where dbProfile is the name of a
# databases profile in hg.conf, and trackDbTbl is the name of the table in the
# remote databases.  See below for details of dbProfile
